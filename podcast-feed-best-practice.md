gPodder Podcast Feed Best Practice
==================================

**Document Status: very early draft**

This document contains best practices for creating podcast feeds that should be
consumed by podcasting clients. It aims to be a guideline for podcast
publishers and systems creating podcast feeds on behalf of them, as well as for
podcast clients need to interpret those feeds.

This document is published by the [gPodder team] [gpodder] but aims for general
compatibility among podcast applications.


Preface
-------

[RSS][rss20] and [Atom][rfc4287] feeds are commonly used to distribute and
describe podcasts. Due to their generic definition, they can be ambigously
interpreted for the use case of podcasts. This often resulted in incompatible
uses of these standards which then caused problems when processing some podcast
feeds.

This document builds upon existing standards and established extensions, and
gives recommendations how these standards should be put to use. It should not
conflict with any standard that is mentioned.


Conventions
-----------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119][RFC2119].


Overview
--------

### Terminology

A _podcast_ is a type of digital media consisting of an episodic series of
media files which are distributed through web syndication. A podcast is
described by one or more _podcast feeds_ (short _feeds_). A podcast contains
any number of _episodes_, each of which is represented by zero or more _media
files_.


### Structure

The remainder of this document is divided into the following sections:

* **General Considerations** discusses general topics related to the
  distribution of podcasts
* **Podcasts** discusses pieces of information that describe a podcast
* **Feeds** discusses more technical details of the feeds describing a podcast
* **Episodes** discusses pieces of information that describe an episode
* **Media Files** discusses more technical details of the mediate files that
  contain the actual content of an episode


General Considerations
----------------------

TODO


Podcasts
--------

One feed describes one podcast and its episodes. There MAY be multiple feeds
describing different views of the same podcast (eg different media types,
different number and or selection of episodes, etc). See section
*Related Feeds*.

* Generator
* Payment URL
* Summary

* Categorization


### Title

The name of the podcast. A feed MUST contain a title, and it must not be
empty. It MAY contain additional classification of the feed (such as "MP3" or
"HQ", etc..) if there are multiple feeds, but if such additional classification
is added, it SHOULD be added to the end of the title. It SHOULD NOT contain
special characters at the end / at the beginning. Avoid terms like "podcast",
"feed", "episodes", etc.. in the title - it will be obvious (or irrelevant) to
your users (exception: if "Podcast" is part of your show's name, it is okay to
have it included in the title).

Paths:
* Atom: `/atom10:feed/atom10:title`
* RSS: `/rss/channel/title`
* RSS (DC): `/rss/channel/dc:title`

Good:
* All My Ponies
* Opinion of Johnny
* FLOSS Daily - HQ
* Beyond the Usual (MP3)

Bad:
* All Podcast Episodes
* MP3 Feed
* Podcast - High Quality
* All Entries
* HQ MP3 - FLOSS
* \> Awesome Podcast <
* [The Super Podcast]


### GUID

A podcast feed SHOULD provide a globally unique Id (GUID).

TODOs
* RSS?
* Should the GUID represent the feed or the podcast?
* Right now, we don't used the (feed-wide) GUID at all in gPodder

Paths:
* Atom `/atom10:feed/atom10:id`


### Link

The URL of the podcast's website. The resource that is available through the
specified URL should be accessible by a browser.

Paths:
* Atom: `/atom10:feed/atom10:link[@rel="alternate"]/@href`
* Atom: `/atom10:feed/atom10:link[not(@rel)]/@href`
* RSS: `rss/channel/link`


### Description

A podcast MUST contain a textual description. The description MAY be formatted
using [Markdown][markdown].  It is RECOMMENDED to provide a short and long
version of the description. If there is only one description for the feed, the
short description SHOULD NOT be used.

Paths (Short Descriptions):
* Atom: `/atom10:feed/atom10:subtitle`
* RSS (iTunes): `/rss/channel/itunes:subtitle` (see [itunes:subtitle](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html#subtitle))

### Update Frequency

It is RECOMMENDED to providate information about the podcast's update
frequency using the [RDF Site Summary Syndication Module][synmod].

If a podcast is not longer updated with new episodes, it is RECOMMENDED to
indicate this by using the
[`<itunes:complete>`](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html#complete)
element from the iTunes extensions.


### Image / Cover

It is RECOMMENDED to provide an image or cover art for a podcast. The URL of
the image MUST be provided. All other information is OPTIONAL.

* RSS (iTunes): (see [itunes:image](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html#image))

**TODOs**
* Atom image?
* Atom: `/atom10:feed/atom10:icon`
* Image requirements?
* path of itunes:image


### License
